    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a norma person couldn't.
        So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need any power that is more exceptional than any power a normal being could possess,</b> and you need 
        to use that power to  accomplish good dedds. otherwise, a opoliceman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
        But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something
        that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
